# Introduction

SPOC is the Simple POint Cloud format used to store 3D geospatial point
data. Each record in a SPOC file has an associated X, Y, and Z
coordinate, and possibly other data fields, like red, green, and blue
color information, classification information, point collection identifier,
intensity information, or arbitrary integer values.

The X, Y, and Z values are stored at 64-bit precision floating point
numbers.

## Motivation

3D point cloud formats (like LAS) do not provide enough support for
common operations. In particular, we need 64-bit precision for the XYZ
locations, and 64-bit point side data for things like connected
component IDs.

In addition, many of the fields in current point cloud formats (like
LAS) contain support for data that are relevant only to files coming
from Lidar sensors. For example, scan angle, first return, number of
returns, timestamp, ..., etc. These fields contain 'dummy' data when
generated by electro-optical sensors, or SAR sensors.

Furthermore, spatial coordiante system information is not relevvant in
many instances.

## LAS files

The ASPRS LAS file format is used to store geospatial data in the form
of point clouds.

The "LAS" stands for LASer, and means that the file came from a Lidar
system. Many, if not most, LAS files are not generated from Lidar
systems but can be Electro-optical, SAR, ..., etc.

## OS Support

This project is defined for Linux-based systems, including MAC OS and
the Windows Linux subsystem.

# Description of SPOC Format

The proposed extension is SPOC, or Simple POint Cloud.

* Points are stored as vectors
* The order of the point records is preserved
* Point locations are stored as 64-bit double precision numbers, so
  about 16 decimal digits of precision is preserved, assuming an IEEE
  754 standard.
* Each point has associated 16- and 32-bit fields that are common to 3D
  point collections, like red, green, blue, intensity, collection ID,
  classification, and arbitrary 64-bit unsigned integer side data.

# Requirements

* Don't pay for what you don't use: FreeWYDU
    The memory footprint is zero for fields that are all zero. When
    point clouds are resized each field is checked, and fields that
    contain all 0's are cleared and their memory is freed.
    Setting individual point values does not trigger a resizing check --
    only resizing operations, or a explicit call to `reallocate()` will
    trigger checks. Also, writing a non-zero value to a field that
    contains all zeros will trigger a resize operation for that field.
    Files are compressed on disk, so this doesn't have as much effect on
    the disk footprint, although most compression schemes have some
    overhead associated with each large block stored on disk. This
    scheme stores a single flag for the entire field, regardless of its
    size.
* Linear complexity
* 64-bit doubles
* Don't rely on data being spatially arranged
* Don't reinvent the wheel: rely on the system's optimization mechanisms
  (disk/memory cache)
* Streaming is not supported. Point clouds are random-access. Point
  clouds are assumed to fit into memory.
* Linux pipes are supported (not for LASlib I/O files)
* Avoid dependencies
    * zlib compression library
    * laslib for las/spoc translation utilities
* Functional programming style: avoid OOP
* SPOC makes assumptions about the byte ordering, and is therefore not
  portable
