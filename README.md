# Introduction

SPOC is the Simple POint Cloud format used to store 3D geospatial data.

A SPOC file consists of a header followed by point records.

The header contains a SPOC file identifier, the spoc format version
numbers, the number of points records contained in the file, and an
arbitrary length data string that can be used to store spatial reference
system data.

Each point record in a SPOC file contains an X, Y, and Z coordinate
stored as 64-bit precision floating point numbers. A point record can
optionally have other associated data fields, like red, green, and blue
color information, classification information, point identifier,
intensity information, or arbitrary integer values.

## Motivation

3D point cloud formats (like LAS) do not provide enough support for
common operations. In particular, we need 64-bit precision for the XYZ
locations, and 64-bit point side data for things like connected
component IDs.

In addition, many of the fields in current point cloud formats (like
LAS) contain support for data that are relevant only to files coming
from Lidar sensors. For example, scan angle, first return, number of
returns, timestamp, ..., etc. These fields contain 'dummy' data when
generated by electro-optical sensors, or SAR sensors.

Furthermore, spatial coordiante system information is not relevvant in
many instances.

## LAS files

The ASPRS LAS file format is used to store geospatial data in the form
of point clouds.

The "LAS" stands for LASer, and means that the file came from a Lidar
system. Many, if not most, LAS files are not generated from Lidar
systems but can be Electro-optical, SAR, ..., etc.

## OS Support

This project is defined for Linux-based systems, including MAC OS and
the Windows Linux subsystem.

# Description of SPOC Format

The proposed extension is SPOC, or Simple POint Cloud.

* Points are stored as a vector of point records
* The order of the point records is preserved
* Point locations are stored as 64-bit double precision numbers, so
  about 16 decimal digits of precision is preserved, assuming an IEEE
  754 standard.
* Each point has associated 16- and 32-bit fields that are common to 3D
  point collections, like red, green, blue, intensity, collection ID,
  classification, and arbitrary 64-bit unsigned integer side data.

# Requirements

* Linear complexity
* 64-bit doubles
* Don't rely on data being spatially arranged
* Don't reinvent the wheel: rely on the system's optimization mechanisms
  (disk/memory cache)
* Linux pipes are supported (not for LASlib I/O files)
* Avoid dependencies
    * zlib compression library
    * laslib for las/spoc translation utilities
* Functional programming style: avoid OOP
* SPOC makes assumptions about the byte ordering, and is therefore not
  portable

## Use Cases

* Given contiguous tiles/octrees of point clouds, create a point cloud
  covering a specified extent.
* Given contiguous tiles/octrees of point clouds, create products across
  all point clouds, but without artifacts near tile boundaries.
* Given contiguous tiles/octrees of point clouds, generate
  multi-resolution points clouds across the entire extent, adjusting
  extents to support lower resolutions as needed. For example, increase
  extent by 4X, while lowering resolution by 4X.
* Machine learning:
    * Rotate, project, etc.
    * Regularization, add noise
* Decimate/undecimate
